Welcome to my page!
======

I am a Statistics PhD student at the University of Bologna. I am currently involved in the research project [**GENPOP**](http://genpop.org) (Genes, genealogies and the evolution of demographic change and social inequality) funded by the European Research Council. 

I have been a visiting scholar at the [**Bayesian Demography Laboratory**](https://www.monicaalexander.com/lab/) at the University of Toronto and at the Research Laboratory on [**Kinship Inequalities**](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/research_6120/independent_research_groups_11668/kinship_inequalities_10703/team/) at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.

I am a Statistician with an interest in Formal Demography, Kinship Dynamics, Digital and Computational Demography and Bayesian Statistics

In my PhD thesis, I develop a Bayesian model to examine fertility patterns in Europe and North America during the historical periods lacking ground-truth demographic data. Harnessing a similar
Bayesian model, I aim to estimate male and female Total Fertility Rates at a subnational level. Additionally, I provide a critical analysis about the employment of digital family trees for population studies.


I am a strong advocate of promoting demographic research across multiple disciplines. 

I am also very passionate about teaching. I believe it is vital to foster enthusiasm in understanding and using Statistics and Demography to answer key societal questions.
